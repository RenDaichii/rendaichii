<p align="center">Two old friends meet again<br />Wearin' older faces<br />And talk about the places they've been<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">Two old sweethearts who fell apart<br />Somewhere long ago<br />How are they to know<br />Someday they'd meet again<br />And have a need for more than reminiscin'<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">Maybe this time<br />It'll be lovin' they'll find<br />Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br />She's back in his life<br />And it feels so right<br />Maybe this time, love won't end<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">It's the same old feeling back again<br />It's the one that they had way back when<br />They were too young to know when love is real<br />But somehow, some things never change<br />And even time hasn't cooled the flame<br />It's burnin' even brighter than it did before<br />It got another chance, and if they take it...<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">Maybe this time<br />It'll be lovin' they'll find<br />Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br />She's back in his life<br />And it feels so right<br />Maybe this time, love won't end<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">She's smilin' like she used to smile way back then<br />She's feelin' like she used to feel way back when<br />They tried, but somethin' kept them<br />Waiting for this magic moment<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">Maybe this time<br />It'll be lovin' they'll find<br />Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br />She's back in his life<br />And it feels so right<br />Maybe this time...<br><br /></p>
<p align="center">Maybe this time<br />Maybe this time love won't end</p>
